# LeetCode Progress Tracker (JavaScript)

This repository documents my journey through LeetCode as I build stronger problem solving skills and deepen my understanding of data structures and algorithms.

The primary goals of this project are:
- Develop algorithmic thinking through hands-on practice
- Strengthen fundamentals in data structures
- Improve implementation skills using JavaScript
- Build a consistent programming habit

---

## Repository Structure

Solutions are organized by LeetCode difficulty:

```
leetcode/
  easy/
  medium/
  hard/
```

Each problem folder includes:
- JavaScript solution
- Brief explanation (whenever applicable)
- Time and space complexity notes

---

## Languages and Tools

- JavaScript (primary)
- Node.js for local execution and testing
- VS Code for development

---

## Study Areas Covered

This repo will grow to include problems that reinforce:
- Arrays and Hash Maps  
- Linked Lists  
- Stacks and Queues  
- Trees and Graphs  
- Recursion and Backtracking  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Greedy Algorithms  
- Sorting and Searching

---

## Commit and Update Strategy

I aim to:
- Solve new problems regularly
- Refactor when I discover better approaches
- Track improvements through commit history

---

## Notes

No LeetCode problem statements are stored here.  
All explanations are written in my own words.

---

## Learning Mindset

This repository reflects ongoing growth.  
Solutions may evolve over time as I revisit concepts or learn more optimized approaches.
